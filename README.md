# Decentralised-communication-using-Blockchain-(DC-CHAT)
A secured decentralised chat application using Blockchain.

Project Description:
In this project the idea of designing the secured Decentralized communication is built on the foundation of the Blockchain. To provide an anonyms chat between to users peer-to-peer this application used. The users under the private network can seen the message which is in encrypted format but cannot decrypt it only the sender and receiver can read it by using their private key. Ethereum provides the platform to work on this by providing an Ethereum wallet unique id to each user under the network. On the Blockchain, each group of transactions is hashed together, along with a hash of the previous block, and the entire Blockchain would be publicly accessible. Using a Blockchain for Secure communication could record encrypted message and user ID, as well as the time. Each user/message is verified in a smart contract before being register/send the message. In our system, the smart contract is that a “DChat” is given to users if it satisfies certain conditions, such as the user registration once checking he user can send and receive the messages. DChat is a platform that allows you to send encrypted messages via a smart contract. Only you and the recipient of a message can decrypt it. All encrypted messages will be available for everyone to see because it is on the Ethereum blockchain, however, only the sender and the receiver can decrypt the messages between them, on one else can intercept it. DChat only depends on the Ethereum network and can work without any centralized server.
